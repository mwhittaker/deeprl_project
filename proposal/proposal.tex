The proposal should be a maximum of one page, and should describe the idea that
you plan to explore for your final and project and the members of your group.
One proposal should be submitted per group. Your proposal should at minimum
answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Which tasks or problems will you study? Where will you get your data or
    simulator (or real-world system)?
  \item
    What is the main research hypothesis your project will be investigate? All
    projects should at least attempt to evaluate novel ideas that pertain to
    deep RL or its applications.
  \item
    How does the topic of your project relate to deep RL?
\end{enumerate}
